```check-dns.py```

* Sends DNS A queries for google.com to the target IP, incrementing IP TTL in each iteration until an injection is detected.

```check-quic.py```

* Sends QUIC Initial (sni=google.com) packets every 5 seconds with increasing TTL values to the target IP. After each QUIC Initial, it sends UDP payloads with a fixed TTL value (64).

To identify the blocking hop for QUIC:

1. Open the `.pcap` file located in the `./QUIC/{location}` directory.
2. Find the first time period where the gap between consecutive packets is >= 180 seconds (i.e. residual blocking period).
3. Examine the packet payload that immediately precede this residual blocking period. The payload contains the hop number (equivalent to the experiment number) that triggered blocking.
